# Rataify

A TUI spotify player. This project is starting as a callback to a research project I once did where I wrote something
similar in python from scratch not using any libraries. Now I hope to use the premise of the project as a challenge and
see what I can create with Rust and already made libraries.

If other music streaming software is supported I may integrate them with the application making it a multimedia 
streaming platform. For now, it will focus on spotify and creating features like recommended songs, albums, etc...
